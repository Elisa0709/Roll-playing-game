## Prerequisites

Before installing and running the project, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Java JDK 17+](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk17-downloads.html)

  
## Description
Run through the dungeons ! Are you a warrior or a magician? Find weapons and potions, fight monsters and try to escape !

To carry out this project, I used:

- Object-oriented programming (OOP) to organise the game in different classes (characters, enemies, stuff)

- Java collections to manage the charactersâ€™ inventories and features

- users input management through the CLI
